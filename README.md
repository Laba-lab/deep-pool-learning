Life & Energy saving AI based system for swimming pools

# Project Title

Building AI course project: "Deep Pool Learning"

## Summary

“Deep Pool Learning” is Life & Energy saving embedded system, based on AI/DeepLearning computer science methods for public pools, private pools and beyond.
Two separate Neural Network based programms are running in real time. With first, photos of the pool ledges are taken and processed to calculate the count of pool users and to finally obtain the output that will be used for cross-check with second program, to signal the alarm, and to operate pool filtration equipement accordingly.
Second program is processing photos of total pool area and calculating its own count that will be cross-check with first program, and directly used to recognise potential drowning that will trigger another/different set of alarms.



## Background

This is 24 hours running standalone system that can be installed on any pool in the world, providing safe and relaxed environment for all users, and in the same time save energy and make healthier pools.

Deep Pool Learning system is used to:
* Save lives
* Save energy 
* Save filtration and heating equpment
* Reduce pool treatment chemicals consumption
* Provide healthier pools
* Provide relaxed environment
* Reduce manning
* Promote AI based technologies
* Promote Green future solutions 


## How is it used?

System is intended to be used by pool owners, parents, managers, pool attendants and pool maintenance technicians. It will scientifically increase pool value in general, it will promote pool safety and healthier environment. For managers and pool owners it will provide significant savings. For pool attendants, if any, and private pool owners it will provide more relaxed and safe environment to work and live in. For pool technicians in will provide less maintenance requirement, more reliable chemical balance and  healthier pools in general, where, in the same time, helping to comply with local rules and regulations requirements, such as USPH or other.

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges
Since we are dealing with life safety of humans or pets, challenging will be to get system to be reliable and trustworthy. What does your project not solve? It’s important to understand that any technological solution will have its limitations.
What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

Deep Pool Learning system will be used in private pools as well, to alarm parents and owners if kids or pet falls in the pool while they are not attending. Alarm can be cell phone massage, audible, light or nay other mean of alarming. It could be extended to public beach areas and beyond.

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
